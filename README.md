# Signup Tutorial

React
Rails
Email

#Description
This app is a prototype app for a client who needed a sign up form for vendors at a health fair.<br/>
They wanted email notifications when a vendor signs up, one to the vendor, and a notification for the client. <br />
I also setup a "backend" for them, so they can see / delete the vendors.
... For later, add all CRUD
